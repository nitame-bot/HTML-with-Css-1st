<h1 style="color:darkblue; text-align: center;"> <b>CURRICULAM CHANGE & THE BIG CHANGE IN CLASS 10 ON 2025  </b></h1>
<br> <p style="color:#8B4513;">In Bangladesh, the practice of using the same textbooks for both Class 9 and Class 10 was introduced with the National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) syllabus revision in 2013. Since then, students in both grades have been studying from the same set of textbooks across various subjects to ensure continuity and better preparation for the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) examinations.</p>

<h2> About New Curriculum of Class 9 </h2>
<p style="color:#fffefb;">In 2023, Bangladesh introduced a new curriculum for Class 9, part of a larger education reform aimed at modernizing the school system. This new curriculum brings significant changes designed to foster critical thinking, creativity, and practical knowledge. Here are the key features of the new curriculum for Class 9 in Bangladesh: <br>
1. Competency-Based Learning:<br>
   - The focus has shifted from rote memorization to competency-based education, aiming to develop skills that prepare students for real-life challenges.<br>
   - Emphasis is on problem-solving, analytical thinking, communication skills, and teamwork. <br><br>

2. Continuous Assessment:
   - A significant change is the introduction of continuous assessment throughout the year, replacing a solely exam-focused system.<br>
   - Students are assessed through class activities, assignments, projects, and practical work.<br>
   - Term exams still exist, but ongoing assessments hold greater importance.<br><br>

 3. Interdisciplinary Approach:<br>
   - Subjects are interconnected to promote holistic learning.<br>
   - Science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) are integrated into the curriculum to enhance students' understanding of how different disciplines relate to one another.<br><br>

4. ICT Integration:<br>
   - Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is integrated into all subjects, not just as a separate discipline.<br>
   - Students are encouraged to use digital tools and resources to enhance their learning experience.<br><br>

5. Environmental and Social Awareness:<br>
   - The new curriculum includes greater emphasis on sustainability, environmental issues, and social responsibility.<br>
   - Lessons on climate change, gender equality, and citizenship are incorporated into various subjects.<br><br>

 6. Textbook Changes:<br>
   - Textbooks have been updated to reflect these modern approaches.<br>
   - The content is now designed to be more student-friendly, promoting interactive learning rather than rote learning.<br>
<br>
7. Practical Learning:
   - Practical experiments, projects, and fieldwork are encouraged, especially in science and social studies subjects, to provide hands-on experience.<br><br>

This curriculum reform is part of Bangladesh's vision to create a more progressive education system that aligns with global standards, while also addressing the needs of its students and society.</p>

<h2>Negative Effects or Challenges of the New curriculum for Class 9</h2>
<p style="color:#fffefb;">The new curriculum in Bangladesh, while progressive and competency-focused, has faced criticism and concerns regarding its implementation and potential drawbacks. Some of the negative effects or challenges of the new curriculum for Class 9 include:
	<br>

 1. Teacher Training and Preparedness:<br>
   - Many teachers may not be adequately trained for competency-based education, continuous assessments, and interdisciplinary teaching.<br>
   - Insufficient teacher training can lead to inconsistent teaching quality and difficulty in adapting to the new methods.<br>
<br>
 2. Overburdening of Teachers and Students:<br>
   - Continuous assessment requires teachers to spend more time on evaluations, which can become overwhelming without proper support.<br>
   - Students, too, may feel the pressure of constant assessments throughout the year, rather than focusing on specific exam periods.<br><br>

 3. Infrastructure and Resource Gaps:<br>
   - The integration of ICT (Information and Communication Technology) into education may not be feasible for all schools, especially in rural areas lacking proper technology infrastructure, internet access, or sufficient funding.<br>
   - Schools in underprivileged areas may struggle to implement practical and interdisciplinary approaches effectively.<br>
<br>
 4. Increased Workload for Students:<br>
   - With the introduction of projects, practical work, and continuous assessments, students may find themselves burdened with more assignments than before, potentially leading to stress or burnout.<br>
   - Balancing project-based learning with traditional studying can become overwhelming for students, especially in competitive environments.<br>
<br>
 5. Implementation Challenges:<br>
   - The new curriculum requires significant systemic changes, which can take time to implement smoothly. There may be inconsistencies in how different schools or regions adopt the changes.<br>
   - Delays in the distribution of updated textbooks or learning materials may hinder smooth learning experiences for students.
   <br>
<br>
6. Assessment Biases:<br>
   - Continuous assessments might lead to subjectivity in grading, as different teachers might evaluate projects or assignments differently, leading to inconsistencies in grading.<br>
   - Students who excel in written exams may struggle with the new assessment methods, especially if their strengths lie outside of project-based or practical work.<br>
<br>
 7. Lack of Parental Understanding:<br>
   - Many parents, especially those from less-educated backgrounds, may struggle to understand the shift from traditional rote-learning to a competency-based system. This can lead to confusion and lack of support for students at home.<br>
<br>
8. Limited Access to Extracurricular Resources:<br>
   - Practical learning requires additional resources like science labs, field trips, or extracurricular materials that many schools may not have. This lack of access can create inequality between well-funded and under-resourced schools.<br>

 9. Focus Shift from Deep Learning:<br>
   - Some critics argue that the focus on continuous assessment and interdisciplinary work might lead to students only "doing what's required" to pass each small assessment, rather than engaging in deep learning or mastering specific subjects.<br>
<br>
These concerns highlight the importance of providing strong teacher support, infrastructure development, and gradual implementation to avoid overwhelming both teachers and students. Without proper preparation and resources, the intended benefits of the curriculum might not be fully realized.</p>

<h3 id=h_choosesub> <b> <i>On 2025 in class 10 student have to choose subjects & study on that <b> </i></h3>
  <br>
  <p id=p_cs>Starting from 2025, Class 10 students in Bangladesh will need to choose specific subjects and focus on those areas of study. This shift is part of the new curriculum aimed at providing students with more flexibility and specialization as they prepare for higher education or vocational paths. Here are the key points regarding this change:
<br>
Subject Specialization<br>
   - Students will be required to select subjects based on their interests and future career goals. These could include science, commerce, arts, or vocational tracks.<br>
   - The goal is to allow students to focus more deeply on subjects that align with their desired educational or professional pursuits.<br>

Core Subjects<br>
   - There will still be a set of core subjects (such as Bangla, English, and Mathematics) that all students must study, ensuring a well-rounded education.<br>
   - The core curriculum also includes social studies, but optional subjects will allow for greater specialization.<br>
Streamlined Learning<br>
   - By choosing subjects earlier, students will have the opportunity to delve deeper into their chosen fields, improving preparation for higher studies, whether in science, commerce, humanities, or technical education.
   - This also reduces the burden of having to study all subjects equally, allowing for more focused learning and less exam pressure in subjects they may not pursue in the future.

Career Preparation<br>
   - The new system is designed to align students' studies with their future aspirations, be it higher education or entering the workforce.
   - Specialized subjects will better equip students with relevant knowledge and skills that are important for university entrance exams or job markets.<br>

Challenges<br>
   - Students at the age of 15 or 16 might face difficulties in deciding their future career paths so early. Proper career counseling will be crucial in helping them make informed decisions.<br>
   - Schools must ensure that they have the resources to offer a wide range of subject choices to all students, which may be challenging for smaller or underfunded schools.<br>

This change is part of a larger effort to modernize the education system and provide students with the ability to make decisions based on their talents and interests.</p><br>
